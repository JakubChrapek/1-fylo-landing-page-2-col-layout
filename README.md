# Frontend Mentor - Fylo landing page with two column layout

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow. I enjoy using them to test my skills in things I learn. This time it is dedicated to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs I was provided with in the /design folder. There are mobile and desktop version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. I use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information I'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Sharing your solution

I leave this section to remember how to share it with frontendmentor community ðŸ˜€

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. Other users will be able to give you feedback, which could help improve your code for the next project.
2. Share your repository and live URL in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
